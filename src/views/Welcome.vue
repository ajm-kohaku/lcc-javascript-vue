      My name is Amber Murphy, and I am a Test Engineer writing and designing
      tests in Java Selenium WebDriver, Jmeter, and manual UI testing. I enjoy
      troubleshooting problems and figuring out how things are put together. I
      spend a great deal of my day breaking down HTML; now I'd like to create
      it.

export default {
